Until James McNab built the first rock garden at Inverleith in 1871, the Garden&apos;s alpines 
were cultivated in pots. Rockeries - landscaped effects with rocks - were popular garden features, 
but rock gardens, designed for true alpines, were something new. McNab&apos;s rock garden comprised numerous 
small, straight-sided compartments, each planted and distinctly labelled.

This part of the Garden highlights RBGE&apos;s well-established links with China and its outstanding 
collection of Chinese plants. RBGE&apos;s close working relationship with China was consolidated 
with the creation of the Lijiang Botanic Garden and Jade Dragon Field Station.For RBGE, it represents 
a long-term commitment to the conservation of this area, working closely with local communities who 
depend on the plants for food, shelter and medicine.
