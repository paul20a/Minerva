McNab&apos;s rock garden comprised numerous small, straight-sided compartments, each planted and distinctly labelled.

This part of the Garden highlights RBGE&apos;s well-established links with China and its outstanding collection of Chinese plants. RBGE&apos;s close working relationship with China was consolidated with the creation of the Lijiang Botanic Garden and Jade Dragon Field Station.For RBGE, it represents a long-term commitment to the conservation of this area, working closely with local communities who depend on the plants for food, shelter and medicine.
